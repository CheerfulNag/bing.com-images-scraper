This scraper allows you to scrap Bing images - anything Bing can find for your search query. This is done with requests-html so that javascript can be rendered, cause bing dont loads all images at once. Thanks to asynchtmlsession - it downloads ~ 950 images in less than 20 minutes even for high resolution and a few minutes less if you need any resolution (you can change the value of the main function parameter so you can choose which one you need). It saves images in a folder that it creates when you run the program.
